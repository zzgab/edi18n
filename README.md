# Targum

A tool to help manage i18n JSON files.

## Launch your own

~~~
yarn start
~~~

## How to use

In the browser, click on _Add File_.
Then provide the URL of a raw JSON file (it can be from GitHub, including from a private repository to which you have access, provided that you are sign-in in the same browser, and if you specify the full URL including _token_ param).

You may add as many JSON files as needed.

Edit the contents, then click on _Download_ to obtain the updated JSON file (you remain responsible
with updating the source of truth (ie. GH PR etc.)).
